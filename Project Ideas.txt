1) Widget system for Mod pages (Kind of like a blog chat system, a gallery/image pane, or a Links box)
2) Make the mod pages customizable by mod authors
3) An optional agreement dialog box where the author can force the user to accept a license agreement before they download a mod
	3.2) For the API interface the user would have to accept an agreement saying that any mod that they download through the API they automatically
			accept the mod's license before they would get an API key.
4) A search option
	4.1) Make a category system where they could filter by mc version, or forge version
	4.2) Also part of that category system they could filter by mythical, technology, world generation, additional blocks, or any categories that we specify
5) System will allow stable, beta, and alpha builds.  Mod authors could put up a mod version for each version combo of minecraft/forge.  
	More likely go with mc version.  This would probably be a download widget.  Include an API url too in the box.
